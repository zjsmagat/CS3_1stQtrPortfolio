```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta name="author" content="<your names>" />
  <meta name="revised" content="<date today>" />
  <style>
    body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
    .header, .footer {
      background: lightblue;
      padding: 10px;
    }
    .footer {
       opacity: 0.5;
    }
    .sidebar {
      background: lightgreen;
      width: 150px;
      height: 200px;
    }
    .content {
      background: lightyellow;
      width: 300px;
      height: 200px;
    }    
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="header">Header</div>
  <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
  <div class="content">Main Content</div>
  <div class="footer">Footer</div>
</body>
</html>
```
### Step 1 (Static vs Relative):

- Add in css ```position: relative; top: 20px; left: 20px;``` to .sidebar.

- Guided Question: What changed compared to the default static positioning? Try to give different values to top and left or you can change it to bottom, right.
- The .sidebar stays in its normal place and cannot be moved using top, left, right, or bottom when using static positioning. If you change it to relative, top, left, right, or bottom can now affect it but it makes it so the other elements of the page are unaffected, only shifting the element around its original position.


### Step 2 (Fixed):

- Add in css ```position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%;``` to .footer.

- Guided Question: What happens when you scroll the page? Why does the footer behave differently from position relative?
- When scrolling the page, the footer stays fixed at the bottom of the screen and does not move. The fixed position attaches the element to the viewport instead of the page layout.


### Step 3 (Absolute):

- Add in css ```position: absolute; top: 66px; left: 200px;``` to .content.

- Guided Question: What is the effect of position: absolute on an element? How is it different from fixed?
- Absolute positioning removes the .content element from the document flow and places it at a specific position using top and left, relative to the nearest parent element to use as its reference.


### Step 4 : (Absolute)

- Add in html ```<div class="notice">Notice!</div>``` and include the css below:

```css
.notice {
    position: absolute;
    top: 60px;
    left: 400px;
    background: orange;
    padding: 10px;
    z-index: 2;
}
```

- Give .content a z-index: 1.

- Guided Question: Why does the notice appear on top of the content? What happens if you swap the z‑index values?
- The .notice appears on top of .content because it has a higher z-index compared to .content. If you swap the z-index values, then .content would appear on top of .notice since z-index controls the stacking of elements.


- Challenge: 
    * What changes that you have to do on the code that will position .notice box on the top right corner of the .content box? Please write the code on paper as well (both html and css on the part of .notice and .content).
    - Make .content position be relative and make .notice to absolute, with top and right at 0.
    * Try to change the position of .content to relative then to fixed. What do you observed each time?
    - If .content is relative, .notice positions itself relative to .content. If .content is fixed, the content box sticks to the screen with .notice staying inside it.
    * What do you observe on about the effect of z-index on .notice and .content boxes?
    - Higher z-index values for an element appears at the top of the other.

3. Please answer the following reflection questions (15 minutes)

    a. Could you summarize the differences between the CSS position values (static, relative, absolute, fixed)? 
    - Static is the default position and can't be moved using top or left. Relative can be moved relative to the original position using top, left, right, bottom. Absolute makes it relative to the nearest parent element. Fixed makes it relative to the screen and makes sure it can't move when scrolling.

    b. How does absolute positioning depend on its parent element?
    - Absolute positioning makes it relative to the nearest parent element. If theres none, it will be positioned relative to the entire page.

    c. How do you differentiate sticky from fixed (you can research on sticky)?
    - Fixed makes an element stay in the same position no matter what, while sticky acts like relative but can become fixed after scrolling past a certain point.

    d. If you were designing a webpage for a school event, how might you use positioning to highlight important information? Please give concrete examples.
    - Using z-index to put important information on top of other elements.
    - Using fixed on a sidebar or a similar element that I wasnt to stay still.
    - An absolute element if I want something to catch the user's attention.
